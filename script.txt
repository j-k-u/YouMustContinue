RESEARCHER: Thank you for taking part in this research study. One of you has been randomly selected to play the role of the TEACHER, and the other to play the role of the STUDENT. Are you ready to begin?

STUDENT: Yes.

TEACHER (player): 
 (a) Yes.
 (b) No.
 
(a) RESEARCHER: Please inform me when you are ready to begin. 
    (on click) RESEARCHER: Are you ready to begin?

(b) RESEARCHER: Good. This study will evaluate the effects of electrical stimuli on memorization ability. STUDENT, you have been provided with a set of associated word pairs to commit to memory. I will be testing you on your recollection of these pairs. TEACHER, when the STUDENT fails to correctly associate a word, you will be instructed to deliver a mild electric shock using the console in front of you. Please follow my instructions and deliver electric shocks only when commanded. 

RESEARCHER: We will begin with words in Pair Group One. TEACHER, please set the voltage to 15 V.

R: mortar. 
S: (silence)
R: Please respond with the associated word. mortar. 
S: (silence)
R: If you do not respond you will be marked as incorrect. The word is mortar.
